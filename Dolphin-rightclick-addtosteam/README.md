# Add to steam

This is a simple application that adds the path passed as a commandline argument to Steam. The .desktop file adds an entry to the right click menu in Dolphin of Windows or Linux executables to add them to Steam. [The source code for the application can be found here](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/Duplicate/tree/main/SimpleSteamShortcutAdder)
